# The Fold

**Scale, twist, collapse — and what is left at the centre.**

Scaling about a datum is the one-parameter family `g_k(P) = P₀ + k(P − P₀)`. Everything in this
paper follows from one determinant, `det(g_k) = kⁿ`: heights scale like `k`, areas like `k²`,
volumes like `k³`. A real `k` changes size, an imaginary one twists, and a twist is the product of
two folds.

## Measured values quoted in the paper

Silhouette change of a cube twisted about a face axis: 0.0% at 0°/90°/180°/270°, 1.4% at 30°,
**12.3% at 45°**; sphere 0.0% at every angle.

Solid angle seen by an exterior point, `Ω/4π`: 5.060% at `k = 1`, 1.216% at `k = 0.5`, 0.301% at
`k = 0.25`. At the centre of the body it is exactly 100% for every `k > 0`.

Horizon formation, `k* = 2GM/(c²R)`: Earth `1.4 × 10⁻⁹`, Sun `4.3 × 10⁻⁶`, a 70 kg sphere of water
`4 × 10⁻²⁵`.

The midpoint map: `m_k(P) = ½(P + g_k P) = g_((1+k)/2)(P)` to `4.6 × 10⁻¹⁶`, with
`det m_k = ((1+k)/2)ⁿ` exact and rank 0 only at `k = −1`. For a fold `σ_H`, `½(I + σ_H)` is the
projection onto the crease (rank `n − 1`): the midpoint set lies in `H` to `2.2 × 10⁻¹⁶`.

Division points: `q_t = (1 − t + tk)P`, collapsing at `k_t = (t − 1)/t` — ¼ ↦ −3, ⅓ ↦ −2, ½ ↦ −1,
2 ↦ ½. Every `k ≠ 1` is owned by exactly one `t = 1/(1−k)` (round trip `1.8 × 10⁻¹⁵`), and
`t ↔ 1−t` pairs `k` with `1/k` to `2.2 × 10⁻¹⁶`. Map iteration is `m^n = g_(f^n)` exactly; repeated
bisection is `f_n = 1 + (k − 1)/2ⁿ`, converging to the identity for every `k`.

## Structure

0. Summary — the one determinant
1. The scale factor and the datum — area and height cannot share a law
2. Two regimes — sphere (interior apex) and cone (boundary apex)
3. The twist — `J² = −I`, and `U(1)/Sym(B)` as the observable quotient
4. The fold, completed — two folds at `α` give a rotation by `2α`; `(σ₂σ₁)⁴ = I`
5. The horizon — two laws: the homothetic family (`M ∝ k`) and the fixed-mass collapse
6. Zero as the point — rank drops from `n` to 0 in one step
7. What an observer can see — dimension fixes the observable
8. Devices — one bench-top instance per step
9. The one sentence
