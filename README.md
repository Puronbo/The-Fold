# The Fold

**Scale, twist, collapse — and what is left at the centre.**

Scaling about a datum is the one-parameter family `g_k(P) = P₀ + k(P − P₀)`. Everything in this
paper follows from one determinant, `det(g_k) = kⁿ`: heights scale like `k`, areas like `k²`,
volumes like `k³`. A real `k` changes size, an imaginary one twists, and a twist is the product of
two folds.

## Measured values quoted in the paper

Silhouette change of a cube twisted about a face axis: 0.0% at 0°/90°/180°/270°, 1.4% at 30°,
**12.3% at 45°**; sphere 0.0% at every angle.

Solid angle seen by an exterior point, `Ω/4π`: 5.060% at `k = 1`, 1.216% at `k = 0.5`, 0.301% at
`k = 0.25`. At the centre of the body it is exactly 100% for every `k > 0`.

Horizon formation, `k* = 2GM/(c²R)`: Earth `1.4 × 10⁻⁹`, Sun `4.3 × 10⁻⁶`, a 70 kg sphere of water
`4 × 10⁻²⁵`.

## Structure

0. Summary — the one determinant
1. The scale factor and the datum — area and height cannot share a law
2. Two regimes — sphere (interior apex) and cone (boundary apex)
3. The twist — `J² = −I`, and `U(1)/Sym(B)` as the observable quotient
4. The fold, completed — two folds at `α` give a rotation by `2α`; `(σ₂σ₁)⁴ = I`
5. The horizon — the boundary case, and why zero is never reached
6. Zero as the point — rank drops from `n` to 0 in one step
7. What an observer can see — dimension fixes the observable
8. Devices — one bench-top instance per step
9. The one sentence
